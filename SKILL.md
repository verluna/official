## COMPANY OVERVIEW

### What is Verluna?
Verluna is a GTM Engineering consultancy that transforms manual revenue operations into automated, scalable systems. We are **engineers who understand go-to-market** - not a marketing agency.

### Location

### Core Positioning
"While others build slide decks, we build systems. While they create campaigns, we create infrastructure."

### Key Differentiators

**1. Code Over Config**
We write infrastructure, not just workflows. Every solution is version-controlled, documented, and built to scale. No duct-tape automation.

**2. Forward Deployed**
We embed with your team via Slack. No handoff documents, no support tickets. We work alongside you until the system runs itself.

**3. Measure Everything**
Every pipeline has metrics, every workflow has logs. You know exactly what's running, when, and why.

### Team Background
Our team comes from DevOps, data engineering, and AI backgrounds. We apply software engineering principles to revenue operations problems.
